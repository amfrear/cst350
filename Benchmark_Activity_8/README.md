## Part 3: Summary of Key Concepts
- **This section reflects on the key software development principles and skills learned during the project.**

### Application Design and Development
Developing the BibleSearchApp deepened my understanding of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, separating concerns between models, views, and controllers. Modeling database relationships allowed efficient storage and retrieval of Bible-related data, such as books, verses, and notes.

### AJAX Integration
One of the most rewarding aspects was implementing AJAX for dynamic features like search results and note management. This made the application more responsive and user-friendly by reducing page reloads.

### Purpose and Impact
The BibleSearchApp aims to provide a user-friendly tool for studying scripture. By enabling keyword and reference searches, along with note-taking capabilities, it enhances personal study and group discussions. The projectâ€™s focus on usability ensures it meets real-world needs effectively.

*This project strengthened my skills in database design, MVC architecture, and AJAX-based client-server communication while contributing to an impactful tool for the Christian community.*
